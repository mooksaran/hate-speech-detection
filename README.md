Hate Speech Detection with BERT
===============================

A machine learning project for detecting hate speech using a fine-tuned BERT model. 
Built with TensorFlow, Transformers, and Streamlit.

Project Objectives
------------------
- Content Moderation: Automatically detect and remove hate speech or offensive content from online platforms.
- Education & Awareness: Flag harmful content and encourage responsible digital behavior.

Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  # Dataset files (train/test/labeled/tweet)
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # Pretrained model files (.h5) - stored externally
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks for training/evaluation
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/               # PDF reports and presentation
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # Source code for training and Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore

Installation
------------
Clone the repository and install required packages:

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hate-speech-detection.git
    cd hate-speech-detection
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Pretrained Model Weights
------------------------
Due to GitHub's file size limit (100MB), model weights are not included in this repository.

Please download the `.h5` model files from Google Drive and place them inside the `models/` folder:

Run the App (Streamlit)
-----------------------
Launch the interactive hate speech detection app using:

    streamlit run src/TermProject.py

This will open a web interface to test predictions in real-time.

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------
Explore model training and evaluation with:

- notebooks/HateSpeechDetectionWithBert.ipynb
- notebooks/Prediction.ipynb

To run:

    jupyter notebook
